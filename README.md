# New Year Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
  This project analyzes a dataset containing sales data for New Year campaigns. It provides insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and product trends to help businesses understand their target    audience and maximize revenue.

## Project Learnings
  -Performed data cleaning and manipulation.
  -Performed exploratory data analysis(EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
  -Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
  -Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the needs.

## Features
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values and removed unrelated columns.
   - Renamed columns for better readability.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized gender distribution, age groups, marital status, and state-wise sales.
   - Analyzed product categories and top-performing states.
3. Insights:
   - Identified key customer segments based on purchasing patterns.
   - Highlighted top-selling products and categories.

## Key Libraries Used
- `numpy` - Numerical computations
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - Data visualization

## Data Cleaning Process
- Removed null values using `dropna()`.
- Changed data types for consistency.
- Renamed columns for clarity.

## EDA Highlights
1. **Gender Analysis:**
   - Most buyers are female with higher purchasing power.
